# Pixi-POC  
*A proof of concept for a roguelite game using the PixiJS library.*  

## Timeline  
- **Start Date:** March 15, 2025  
- **Due Date:** March 18, 2025  

## Goals  

- **Room & Obstacles**: Create a game room with various obstacles.  
- **Character Logic**:  
  - Implement movement mechanics.  
  - Add a hitbox to prevent the character from passing through walls.  
- **Character Design**: Design the main character's appearance from all angles.  
- **Enemies**:  
  - Introduce enemies with randomized movement patterns.  

By experimenting with these mechanics, we can evaluate whether PixiJS is the best choice for our game.
